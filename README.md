- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Javi Rico!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in applied mathematics, specially in solving physical problems through differential equations!
- Of course, the solving process requires programming and that is why I am here. I will share (maybe useful) code that allows me to solve engineering problems!
- Do not hesitate in contacting me, I am always very willing to discuss about maths or life in general :)
